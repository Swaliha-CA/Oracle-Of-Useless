# The Oracle of Nonsense

Welcome to **The Oracle of Nonsense**, a web experiment in chaotic design and beautifully useless feedback. This project is a "password strength judger" that intentionally subverts user expectations for a hilariously pointless experience.

Instead of providing useful security advice, the Oracle offers random, nonsensical judgments on whatever the user types.

> "Weak: This password has bad energy."

The entire visual design is built to enhance this absurdity, featuring a constantly shifting gradient background, a wobbling container, and a glorious neon glow.
